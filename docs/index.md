# Helping

I wanted to make the headline: Helping Others.

Decided not to, because when you are able to help others you are really helping yourself.

Back in 2018 I was working tirelessly on the different courses I got.

One of them was about control theory. The content was not the hardest but in order to understand what’s expected of you you needed to have a idea on how to anaylze and construct control systems.

I was pretty novice on resource management back than. I knew that there was a book on the course content which would help me a lot but it wasn’t a cheap one. The ones on the library was reserved always.

So one night I was in the study hall that we have in the faculty, kinda curiıosly wondering in between bookshelves.
