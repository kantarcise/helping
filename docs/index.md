# Helping

I wanted to make the headline of this ***Helping Others***.

Decided not to, because when you are able to help others you are really helping yourself.

Back in 2018 I was working tirelessly on the different courses I got.

One of them was about control systems.

The content was not the hardest, but in order to understand what’s expected of you you needed to have a idea on how to analyze and construct control systems.

I was pretty novice on resource management (attention, time, money) back than.

I knew that there was a book on the course content which would help me a lot but it wasn’t a cheap one.

The ones on the library was reserved always.

One evening I was in the study hall that we have in the faculty, kinda curiously wondering in between bookshelves.

There it was!

The book that I was looking for was in the top shelf, just waiting for me to find it.

It was a book that a graduate student left, and it had all the questions and additional notes inside for me to study.

I’ve **never** forgot the gratitude I’ve felt in that moment.

After the finals, I left the book where I found but never left the story.

…

2 weeks ago (May 2025), I executed on my long planned idea to pay this gratitude back.

I had all the handwritten course notes that I’ve taken in my undergraduate years gathered in a single place.

Course by course, separated by bags which has teddy bears and hearts on top.

All the notes I’ve taken in preparation for midterms and finals.

Everything I’ve made as an undergraduate.

I knew the perfect spot to put these.

The big magazine shelve at the entrance to our building.

I tidied up all the existing old notes in it, cleaned the selves a bit and arranged all the notes as eye catching as possible.

I’ve left a note saying:

> Feel free to use these as you wish. If you find it valuable, please consider sharing it with others too.

The world needs kindness. And kindness results in more kindness.  

All you need to do is to find your way of kindness.
